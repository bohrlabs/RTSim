### RTsim Development
- Developing **RTsim**, a simulation framework with a backend and frontend.
- **Backend**:
  - Loads addons to run feature code.
  - Designed to run on **Linux** as well.
- **Frontend**:
  - Loads the same addons for visualization purposes.
  - Utilizes **Dear ImGui** with **OpenGL** for the user interface.
- Aims to create a framework for:
  - Personal use.
  - Educational purposes.
  - Private projects.
- Team is already using an earlier version of this framework.
- Plans to integrate **imnodes**:
  - Enables graphical configuration of connections between addons.
  - Similar to Blueprints in Unreal Engine.
  - Enhances usability and accessibility of the framework.

### Language
- Utilizing **C++23** for development.
- Avoiding the use of the **Boost** library:
  - Prefers minimal dependencies to keep the framework lean.
  - Aims for simplicity and transparency in the codebase.
  - Open to including Boost if there's a compelling reason.

### Visualization & UI
- Using **Dear ImGui** with **OpenGL** for the user interface.
- Planning to incorporate **ImPlot** for graphing capabilities:
  - Aims to provide interactive and real-time visualizations of simulations.
- Considering integrating **imnodes** for graphical node-based configurations:
  - Allows users to visually configure connections between addons.

### Inter-Process Communication
- Implementing communication between plugins and frontend/backend using **plain shared memory**:
  - Prioritizing speed due to the large amount of data transferred between addons.
  - Crafted a rudimentary synchronization protocol.
- Considering using libraries like **FlatBuffers** or **ZeroMQ**:
  - **ZeroMQ** offers high-performance asynchronous messaging.
    - Sparked interest due to potential performance benefits.
  - **FlatBuffers** provides efficient serialization with zero-copy access.
- Avoiding serialization protocols to minimize overhead and maximize efficiency:
  - Casting shared memory pointers directly to C structures.

### Shared Memory Advantages
- Chose shared memory for performance benefits and security aspects:
  - Offers high-speed data transfer essential for large datasets.
- Allows easy integration with applications like **MATLAB** or **Python**:
  - Facilitates connections to other tools via shared memory ports.
- Developers creating addons know the internal data structures:
  - Reduces the need for interface descriptions or serialization.
- Custom protocols handle synchronization and memory management.
- Abstracted shared memory handling for cross-platform compatibility.

### Avoiding Boost Library
- Decided against using the **Boost** library:
  - Preferring minimal dependencies to keep the framework lean.
  - Aims for simplicity and transparency in the codebase.
- Open to including Boost if a compelling need arises.

### Interface Descriptions
- Opted not to use interface descriptions or serialization protocols:
  - Developers have intimate knowledge of the data structures.
  - Casting shared memory pointers directly to C structures.
- Enhances performance by eliminating serialization overhead.
- Acknowledges potential synchronization and compatibility issues:
  - Faces challenges but chooses this approach for current needs.

### Cross-Platform Support
- Targeting **Windows** as the main platform.
- Backend designed to run on **Linux** as well:
  - Abstracted shared memory handling for cross-platform compatibility.
  - Addresses OS-specific differences in shared memory implementation.
- Avoiding platform-dependent libraries where possible.

### Multilanguage Support
- Putting aside multi-language integration for now.
- Considering integrating **Python** as a scripting language in the future:
  - Could enhance extensibility and attract a broader developer base.
- Open to exploring other scripting languages like **Lua**:
  - Aims to lower the barrier to entry for addon development.

### Future Enhancements
- Planning to use **imnodes** for graphical configuration:
  - Provides a visual method to configure addon interactions.
- Exploring new libraries like **FlatBuffers** and **ZeroMQ**:
  - Interested due to potential performance and flexibility benefits.
- Embracing modern features of **C++23**:
  - Leveraging new language capabilities to improve the framework.
- Considering performance profiling and testing tools:
  - Tools like **Google Benchmark** and **Catch2** for monitoring and optimization.
- Aiming to create an application for private use, education, and experimentation:
  - Provides a sandbox for testing cutting-edge ideas without constraints.
